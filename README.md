FOODME

	
Foodme is a comprehensive multi-restaurant food ordering & delivery app that allows customers to place food orders online from any of the registered restaurants in an area using their smartphone or tablet device and get it delivered to their doorsteps in a quick and efficient manner.
 It provides an Admin Dashboard, a Restaurant dashboard, a Delivery Application, and a full-fledged Customer dashboard.


### HOW FOODME WORKS?
From placing orders via the customer app to order confirmation by the restaurant and pick-up & delivery by the driver, here’s how the Foodme food delivery app works:

Step 1. Placing an order
The customer downloads and installs the Foodme app on his smartphone or uses the website. Then, he opens the app, selects the restaurant he wants to order from, browses through the menu to select the food items and quantity, and adds them to the cart.

After selecting the order, the customer makes the payment, upon which the order is placed. He can then start tracking the order status.

Step 2: Order management by restaurant
	
As soon as an order is placed via the Foodme app, a notification for the same is sent to the particular restaurant on its dedicated dashboard. The restaurant has the option to accept or reject the order. Upon acceptance, the order is processed by the cooking staff and a bill for the same is printed automatically. Once the restaurant staff confirms an order, a notification to the nearest delivery person is sent automatically, who then arrives at the restaurant to pick the food.

Step 3: Delivery by the driver

A Foodme driver or delivery person who receives the notification from the restaurant app can see the restaurant location in the driver app and use the map to reach the restaurant. He then waits for the food to be prepared. Once the order is prepared, the driver picks the order and travels to the customer’s location, using the navigation in the app, to deliver the food.

Customers can track the live order status, check the delivery person’s location and estimated time of arrival in his app.

Step 4: Delivery and Feedback

Food is delivered to the customer, and the order status changes to ‘delivered’. The customer can review/rate the order and delivery person in the app.
